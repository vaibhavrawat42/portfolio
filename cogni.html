				<p class="text" id="top"> In December 2016, Design Studio was entrusted with the task of Creative management for Cognizance,
                    the annual Technical Festival of IIT Roorkee. I was made the Co-Convener - Design for the festival and was 
                    given the responsibility of leading the team and coordinating with the administrative,promotion and sponsorship team.</p>

				
			     
            <p class="text">Cognizance is the second largest technical festival in Asia and has a budget of almost 1.25 crore rupees. It involves more than 150 events, workshops, exhibitions and live shows for around 3000 participants from all around the country. Also, the design team for this edition was much smaller than those for the 
            previous editions. Thus it was important to have a well thought out plan to proceed upon. To expand the 
            team, we recruited first yearites to the studio in January and started teaching them by handing them projects.We decided to build a design philosophy around the theme for the festival - “EUREKA 2.0”. This process involved days of brainstorming and research </p>
       <p class="text">We started by designing the COGNIZANCE brochure. Designing it was an extensive process and 
            involved going through a lot of iterations. After countless hours of research, browsing hundreds of websites 
            looking for inspiration, brainstorming, scrapping ideas and dreaming new ones, we were finally able to come 
            up with a design philosophy that we were happy to go ahead with.

           <img class="five" src="brochure.png">
			<p class="text">Initially, we were a team of three. Slowly, we started picking up pace. We were thinking both quicker and better. As soon as we finished working on developing a design language, we discussed all the deliverables with the promotion and marketing team of
                cognizance and penned down the smallest thing possible that we needed to design and that too with the deadlines. The white 
                board we used did not have an inch left to write anything else after we were done with listing the deliverables.<br>
                We realized pretty quickly that if we were to even hope of finishing our work on time, we needed more hands on board and my 
                experience of 2 years with cognizance had taught me the shortcomings that we had in the past and also the way to pull those off. 
                So we planned our recruitment process and around the end of January, after shortlisting candidates through written tests and then 
                interviewing the shortlisted candidates, we recruited 10 juniors to be a part of the design team. The new recruits, although 
                possessing a good design sense, still had a lot to learn. </p>
			
           <p class="text">Teaching can often get very grueling. That is where grit and passion come into the picture.We explained each of them the design language 
            that we developed and tried to inculcate the basic principles of design by making them go through design references that were essential 
            in making them work efficiently. New recruits were given the job of designing events’ posters and other marketing collaterals were being 
            taken care of by me and the two designers whom I started with.<br>

            These are some of the posters for events that see more participation.

          <p class="text"> We were right on track and the new recruits proved their metal as the fest days came closer. 5 weeks before the fest I met with the promotion and marketing team again and revised the deliverables as the new sponsors came in and some events were canceled. Then the job of designing flexes and banners was started.<br>We used themes for flexes of different categories like image manipulation for robotics based events and flat graphics for theme events.</p>

                  <img src="flex3.png" style="width:45%">
              <img src="flex4.png" class="myslide" style="width:45%">
              
           </div>
            
          
            
            <p class="text">Doing the design for Cognizance also involved making bags, T-shirts and ID cards.</p>
           
            <img src="" style="">
            <p class="text">
                While learning something new, failure is your best friend. It is the only way we can learn to do better. Often when we thought we were through with a design, it would get scrapped and we’d have to start all over again. Sometimes, the events for which we had spent days designing posters and flexes would be canceled.

            </p>
           
           <p class="text">
               It was in March, just a couple of days before the fest, that we finished our project. The days of the fest were some of the best ones so far. 
                Roaming around with no care in the world, getting pictures clicked with our designs and eating amazing things all day long! Designing fort 
                Cognizance has made me better both as a designer and as a manager. It has taught me how to better work with others but 
                most importantly, it has given me many amazing memories.</p>
