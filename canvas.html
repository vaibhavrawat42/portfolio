            <p class="text">This is a design sprint that I did during my internship at The Minimalist. Canvas Talent is an agency that books artists for its clients. The minimalist was approached by Canvas Talent with a project of designing their website. My task during this sprint was to design the a few pages  of their website to pitch them our idea and the processes that would follow during the project. I went through a complete process of research, wireframing, designing and documenting during the sprint. Prototyping was left out considering the constraint of time. </p>
       <p class="text"><span>Client’s Requirement</span><br>
        They needed a website that can showcase their exclusive artists and their portfolio. They wanted a vibrant look according to the profession they deal with. User, who look for artists for their events should find their desired artists, along with their popularity stats and facilitating the process of exploring events in which they have performed.
          </p>
           
			<p class="text"><span>Functionality Modules</span><br>
            I structured the site into 7  sections which would serve as the category of navigation.<br>

            1. Home Page : Representing the brand and value attributed to the website through graphics and images.<br>
            2. Artists Page : Listing different artist provided by the agency with the links to specific pages of each artist.<br>
            3. Artist profile page : Contains artists bio, his/ her popularity statistics , gallery and the artist,s requirements.<br>
            4. Events : Contains the list of events to be organized by the agency.<br>
            5. Clients : Lists of various clients of the agency.<br>
            6. Services : services that the agency provides to its clients <br>
            7. About : Agency’s description.<br>
            8. Contacts : Information including address, contacts and social media links.</p>
			
           <p class="text"><span>Initial Sketches</span><br>
                I started off with paper sketches to decide the initial wireframes of the pages and to visually formulate my ideas. I designed 2 iterations of the landing page . One with the conventional horizontal navigation bar and one with the vertical navigation bar.</p>            
            
           <div class="posters" style="max-width:100%">
              <img src="canvas_pic1.jpg" style="width:30%">
              <img class="mySlides" src="canvas_pic2.jpg" style="width:30%">
              <img class="mySlides" src="canvas_pic3.jpg" style="width:30%">
           </div>
           
           
           <p class="text"><span> Branding</span><br>
              I opted for fonts and color which would be vibrant and elegant at the same time, representative of the agency’s  genre of work..</p>
            <p class="text">Fonts :  </p>
              <div class="flex" style="max-width:100%">
              <img src="branding_canvas1.png"  style="width:20%">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text">Color:</p>
       <div class="flex" style="max-width:100%">
              <img src="branding_canvas2.png"  style="width:20%">
           
       </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text"><span>Final Screens</span><br>
                As mentioned above i made two iterations for the landing page. The difference being the navigation bar.
                In both the pages i provided a Call to Action button for booking tickets to facilitate the users in booking tickets using least number of clicks.<br><br>
                <span>Home Page</span><br>
                Iteration 1<br>                
                In the first iteration I used the vertical navigation menu.<br><br>
                    <img src="canvas_image2.png" style="width: 100%; display: block; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                Iteration 2<br>                
                In the first iteration I used the conventional navigation menu with all the categories on the top.<br><br>
                <img src="canvas_image1.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;margin-bottom: 50px;"></p>
                    <p class="text">
               <span>Artist Profile Page</span><br>                
                In the first iteration I used the vertical navigation menu.<br><br>
                    <img src="canvas_profile.png" style="width: 100%; display: block; margin-bottom: 50px;">
